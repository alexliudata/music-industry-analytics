# 🎵 Music Industry Analytics

**Strategic Insights for Artists and Labels**

> *"Which music genres are gaining momentum in the market, and what strategic opportunities exist for artists and labels to capitalize on emerging trends?"*

## 📊 Project Overview

This music industry analytics platform helps artists, labels, and industry professionals understand market trends and make better decisions. It analyzes Billboard Hot 100 data and Spotify audio features to spot which genres are gaining traction and which artists are on the rise.

**Note:** This project uses simulated data modeled to reflect known industry patterns and Billboard chart dynamics. The momentum calculations, market share analysis, and audio feature correlations are approximations based on realistic music industry trends.

- **Genre Classification**: Simplified genre categories - real industry uses more granular classifications

### Planned Enhancements
- [ ] **Real-time Data**: Integrate with Billboard API for live chart data
- [ ] **Advanced Audio Analysis**: Include more sophisticated audio feature extraction
- [ ] **Social Media Integration**: Add Twitter/Instagram sentiment analysis
- [ ] **Predictive Modeling**: Implement ML models for trend forecasting
- [ ] **Export Functionality**: Add PDF report generation for stakeholders

### Technical Debt
- [ ] **Performance**: Optimize for larger datasets (currently limited to ~1000 songs)
- [ ] **Caching**: Implement better caching strategy for real-time updates
- [ ] **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit tests (currently ~60% coverage)
- [ ] **Documentation**: Expand API documentation for custom analysis
