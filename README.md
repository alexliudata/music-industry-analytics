**Strategic Insights for Artists and Labels**

> *"Which music genres are gaining momentum in the market, and what strategic opportunities exist for artists and labels to capitalize on emerging trends?"*

## 📊 Project Overview

This music industry analytics platform helps artists, labels, and industry professionals understand market trends and make better decisions. It analyzes Billboard Hot 100 data and Spotify audio features to spot which genres are gaining traction and which artists are on the rise.
